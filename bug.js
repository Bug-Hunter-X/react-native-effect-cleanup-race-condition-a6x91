In React Native, a subtle issue can arise when using the `useEffect` hook with asynchronous operations and cleanup functions. If the asynchronous operation (e.g., a network request) inside `useEffect` takes longer than the component unmounts, the cleanup function might not be executed, leading to unexpected behavior or memory leaks.  This often happens when navigating away from a screen quickly. For example:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    setData(data);
  };

  fetchData();

  return () => {
    console.log('Cleanup function executed');
    // Clean up resources, e.g., abort the fetch request
    // ...
  };
}, []);
```

If the component unmounts before `fetchData` completes, the `console.log` inside the cleanup function won't be called, and any cleanup logic within it is skipped.
